        <p>The movie takes place on the grounds of the fictional Barden University. It follows the acapella group, the Barden Bellas and their quest for redemption after an embarrassing finish at the 2011 International Championship of Collegiate Acapella (ICCAs).</p>
        <p>It has since kicked-off the trilogy of Pitch Perfect movies and inspired a spin-off following ex-lead Treblemaker, Bumper (played by Adam Devine). The movies have been a cornerstone of my repeat movie watching habits for almost a decade! The first Pitch Perfect has been such a classic and so impactful to my life, not to mention its impact on a generation of kids (me included) aspiring to join an acapella group.</p>
        <p>My favourite song/mashup from the movie soundtrack is known as the "Pool Mashup" featuring Just the Way You Are by Bruno Mars and Just a Dream by Nelly. It marks a pivotal moment in the movie where the Bellas transition towards their new modern sounds.</p>
        <p>I recently learned that this movie is in fact not an original screenplay, and is instead a loosely adapted version of Mickey Rapkin's non-fiction book, titled <i>Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory</i>.</p>
        <p>Overall, if you have never seen this masterpiece of a movie, Alex (my roommate) and I highly highly recommend it! It’s also on Netflix right now :D</p>
